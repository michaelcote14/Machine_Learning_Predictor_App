1. Encode all categorical data using one_hot_encoder and one_hot_encoder_multiple
2. Scale data
3. Find which features have the abs(highest value) using correlator
4. Plug these into feature_combinations to get best features
5. Plug these into main_trainer to train your pickle model
6. Run your predictions through Predictor
# When should I scale data?
# When should I visualize data?
